# Networking-Set-Up
 Router - Switch - PC Configuration


## Introduction

In this networking project, I am designing and configuring a simulated network environment. Utilizing Cisco Packet Tracer, a powerful network simulation tool, I will demonstrate the functionality and interconnectivity of basic network devices, including switches for local traffic management and a router for directing traffic between different networks. This project aims to showcase the essential skills required for network configuration and management in a controlled setting.

The network will consist of two switches, one router, and 4 PCs, with each device configured through a Command Line Interface (CLI) to ensure precision and a deeper understanding of networking principles. By using CLI, I will gain hands-on experience in executing commands and troubleshooting potential issues within the network.

Understanding how to configure network devices in a real-world environment is crucial for any business, as it ensures efficient communication and data transfer across the organization. Moreover, the quality of configurations directly impacts network performance, security, and reliability, making it imperative for IT professionals to master these skills.
